# SpigotMGR
A Tool for downloading or updating Spigot builds/downloading plugins from spigotmc.org

This is what we have been looking for and should be useful in our startup script to update the proper plugins.
We will most likely change this to pull from Github instead of spigot or maybe both...

We will need to convert our startup script to use python but I think this would be a welcome addition instead of bash.
